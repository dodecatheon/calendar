python scripts to implement Conway "mental math" calculators for dates

I recently discovered a number of algorithms by John H. Conway that can be used for mental
calculation.  Most of these were described in

Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays, Vol. 2
by Elwyn R. Berlekamp (Author), John H. Conway (Author), Richard K. Guy (Author)

published in 1983 and revised in 2003.

This repo is to collect python scripts I wrote to implement the algorithms, which helps me remember how
to do them mentally and also check whether I'm getting them correct.
